    ReferenceSet:
      description: A `ReferenceSet` is a set of `Reference` s which typically comprise a reference assembly, such as `GRCh38`. A `ReferenceSet` defines a common coordinate space for comparing reference-aligned experimental data.
      type: object
      properties:
        assemblyPUI:
          description: The remaining information is about the source of the sequences Public id of this reference set, such as `GRCh37`.

        referenceSetDbId:
          description: The reference set ID. Unique in the repository.
          type: string
        isDerived:
          description: A reference set may be derived from a source if it contains additional sequences, or some of the sequences within it are derived (see the definition of `isDerived` in `Reference`).

          type: boolean
        md5checksum:
          description: |-
            Order-independent MD5 checksum which identifies this `ReferenceSet`.

            To compute this checksum, make a list of `Reference.md5checksum` for all
            `Reference` s in this set. Then sort that list, and take the MD5 hash of
            all the strings concatenated together. Express the hash as a lower-case
            hexadecimal string.
