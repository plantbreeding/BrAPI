        A `Variant` represents a change in DNA sequence relative to some reference.
        For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion.
        Variants belong to a `VariantSet`.
        This is equivalent to a row in VCF.

            In the case of structural variants, start and end of the variant may not
            be known with an exact base position. "cipos" provides an interval with
            high confidence for the start position. The interval is provided by 0 or
            2 signed integers which are added to the start position.
