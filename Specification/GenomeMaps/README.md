# Overview

Retrieving genetic or physical maps
- type: [Genetic | Physical]
- unit: [cM | Mb]
- linkageGroup: may be scaffold (i.e. linkageGroupCount may consist of chromosomes or scaffolds or a combination of the two)
- For genetic maps, map naming convention should tell whether it is a consensus or mapping population (name of population) map for genetic maps
- For physical maps, map naming convention should tell whether it is a reference genome (name of line) or pan-genome
