      description: |-
        Submit a search request for `images`<br/>
        Search requests allow a client to send a complex query for data. However, the server may not respond with the search results immediately. 
        If a server needs more time to process the request, it might respond with a `searchResultsDbId`. 
        Use the corresponding `GET /search/images/{searchResultsDbId}` to retrieve the results of the search. <br/> 
        Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Search_Services#POST_Search_Entity">Search Services documentation</a> for additional implementation details.

        Image Implementation Notes<br/>
        - `imageURL` should be a complete URL describing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retrieving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.<br/>
        - `descriptiveOntologyTerm` can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI's.<br/>
