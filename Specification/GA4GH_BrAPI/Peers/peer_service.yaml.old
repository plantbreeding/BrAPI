      summary: |-
        Allows a client to notify a service of a potential peer.
        Services are expected to log these requests and implement
        policies for adding peers to their peer lists as desired.
      description: |-
        The AnnouncePeerResponse only notifies the requester whether
        the request was valid. To find if their announce request
        has been accepted they must make a `ListPeersRequest`.
        `POST /peers/announce` must accept a JSON version of
        `AnnouncePeerRequest` as the post body and will return a JSON
        version of `AnnouncePeerResponse`.

              http://1kgenomes.ga4gh.org

            Trailing slashes should be ignored when constructing client
            requests based on this peer, and so shouldn't be included.

            This example shows a peer that has specified both a base path
            and a port.
