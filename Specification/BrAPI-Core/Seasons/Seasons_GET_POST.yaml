        Call to retrieve all seasons in the database.
        
        A season is made of 2 parts; the primary year and a term which defines a segment of the year. 
        This could be a traditional season, like "Spring" or "Summer" or this could be a month, like 
        "May" or "June" or this could be an arbitrary season name which is meaningful to the breeding 
        program like "PlantingTime_3" or "Season E"
      parameters:
      - description: The unique identifier for a season. For backward compatibility it can be a string like '2012', '1957-2004'
        example: b230a1d2, Spring_2017, 3
