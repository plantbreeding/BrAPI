            Observation levels indicate the granularity level at which the measurements are taken. `levelName` defines the level, `levelOrder` defines where that level exists in the hierarchy of levels. `levelOrder`s lower numbers are at the top of the hierarchy (ie field > 0) and higher numbers are at the bottom of the hierarchy (ie plant > 6).
