        Implementation Notes
        
        Having a consistent structure for the path string of each call is very 
        important for teams to be able to connect and find errors. Read more on Github.
        
        Here are the rules for the path of each call that should be returned
        
        Every word in the call path should match the documentation exactly, both in 
        spelling and capitalization. Note that path strings are all lower case, but 
        path parameters are camel case.
        
        Each path should start relative to \"/\" and therefore should not include \"/\"
        
        No leading or trailing slashes (\"/\") 
        
        Path parameters are wrapped in curly braces (\"{}\"). The name of the path parameter 
        should be spelled exactly as it is specified in the documentation.
        
        Examples 
        
        GOOD   "call": "germplasm/{germplasmDbId}/pedigree" 
        
        BAD    "call": "germplasm/{id}/pedigree"
        
        BAD    "call": "germplasm/{germplasmDBid}/pedigree" 
        
        BAD    "call": "brapi/v2/germplasm/{germplasmDbId}/pedigree" 
        
        BAD    "call": "/germplasm/{germplasmDbId}/pedigree/" 
        
        BAD    "call": "germplasm/<germplasmDbId>/pedigree"
