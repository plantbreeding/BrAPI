Identify \nthis observation unit by each level of the hierarchy where it exists. \n\nFor more information on Observation Levels, please review the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wiki.brapi.org/index.php/Observation_Levels\">Observation Levels documentation</a>. \n\n**Standard Level Names: study, field, entry, rep, block, sub-block, plot, sub-plot, plant, pot, sample** ",
