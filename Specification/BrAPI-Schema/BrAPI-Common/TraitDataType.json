Code is a nominal scale that combines the expressions of the different traits composing the complex trait. For example a severity trait might be expressed by a 2 digit and 2 character code. The first 2 digits are the percentage of the plant covered by a fungus and the 2 characters refer to the delay in development, e.g. \"75VD\" means \"75 %\" of the plant is infected and the plant is very delayed.</p>\n<p>\"Date\" - The date class is for events expressed in a time format, See ISO 8601</p>\n<p>\"Duration\" - The Duration class is for time elapsed between two events expressed in a time format, e.g. days, hours, months</p>\n<p>\"Nominal\" - Categorical scale that can take one of a limited and fixed number of categories. There is no intrinsic ordering to the categories</p>\n<p>\"Numerical\" - Numerical scales express the trait with real numbers. The numerical scale defines the unit e.g. centimeter, ton per hectare, branches</p>\n<p>\"Ordinal\" - Ordinal scales are scales composed of ordered categories</p>\n<p>\"Text\" - A free text is used to express the trait.</p>",
