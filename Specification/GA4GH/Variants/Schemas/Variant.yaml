    Variant:
      description: |-
        A `Variant` represents a change in DNA sequence relative to some reference.
        For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion.
        Variants belong to a `VariantSet`.
        This is equivalent to a row in VCF.
      properties:
        alternate_bases:
          description: |-
            The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Multiple alternate
            alleles are possible.

        calls:
          description: |-
            The variant calls for this particular variant. Each one represents the
            determination of genotype with respect to this variant. `Call`s in this
            array are implicitly associated with this `Variant`.

            Similar to "cipos", but for the variant's end position (which is derived
            from start + svlen).
            Example:
              [ -1000, 0 ]
          type: array
        cipos:

            type: integer
          title: |-
            In the case of structural variants, start and end of the variant may not
            be known with an exact base position. "cipos" provides an interval with
            high confidence for the start position. The interval is provided by 0 or
            2 signed integers which are added to the start position.
            Based on the use in VCFv4.2
            Example:
              [ -12000, 1000 ]

          description: |-
            The end position (exclusive), resulting in [start, end) closed-open
            interval.
            This is typically calculated by `start + referenceBases.length`.

        filters_failed:

        start:
          description: |-
            The start position at which this variant occurs (0-based).
            This corresponds to the first base of the string of reference bases.
            Genomic positions are non-negative integers less than reference length.
            Variants spanning the join of circular genomes are represented as
            two variants one on each side of the join (position 0).

            The "variant_type" is used to denote e.g. structural variants.
